"""Aggregate os_schedule_gen's grouped suites, bare-runnable (python test_os_schedule_gen.py).

Why this file is thin
---------------------
The suites live one level down, in the ``tests/`` grouped-suite dir, and this file is
the one entry point that runs them all. Coverage flows the same way: the nested suites
are loaded from here, so they are measured under this one ``coverage run``.

The floor below is the point of the file
----------------------------------------
An empty ``unittest.TestLoader.discover`` is a passing run: ``Ran 0 tests``, exit 0. So
a renamed suite dir, a discovery pattern that stops matching, or an import that quietly
fails would turn this aggregator into a green no-op gating nothing at all, while the run
still looked healthy. Per-file floors are the guard, keyed to the file set: a suite
module added later fails as unfloored rather than being absorbed into a combined
total, which a gain elsewhere can mask."""

# What each grouped file must yield, floored separately rather than as one combined total.
# The guard exists because an empty or half-failed discovery is otherwise a passing run:
# "no tests ran" and "every test passed" are the same exit code, and nothing else in the
# run distinguishes them. One combined floor decays by growth, though. Once the suite
# exceeds it by more than the smallest file holds, that file can be lost whole while the
# total still clears the floor, and the guard goes on passing while guarding nothing. A
# per-file floor closes that by construction, and the key-set comparison below means a file
# added later fails as unfloored instead of being absorbed into a combined number.
#
# Restated, not derived: a floor computed from discovery would compare discovery against
# itself and pass for an empty suite, which is the defect this guard exists to catch.
